# smartmeter-p1 v2
Readout of a Flemish smartmeter via the P1 port and publish it to MQTT.
The meter uses the DSMR v5 protocol, so probably recent Dutch meters can be read out.

## Software

The software is intended to run on an ESP8266 device.
It's a rewrite of my v1, this time made with platformIO.

## Hardware

The hardware is not changed for this version, so see smartmeter-p1-v1 for the hardware.

## Risk

This is a work in progress. Using any of this is at your own risk.
